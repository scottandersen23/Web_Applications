## This is a project I created that demostrates some basic level coding in JavaScript, using CSS and HTML.

##### (The game works best in GoogleChrome)

Simply enter a number between 1-20 into the blank box. The application should return a "Too High!" or "Too Low!" message and subtract your high score from the number of guesses. However, if you get the number correct, the program will light up the screen with a green color and say CORRECT!

Tools used:

1. VS Code
2. Google Dev Console
3. JavaScript
4. CSS
5. HTML
